# Weather Forecast

__WeatherForecast__ is a simple iOS client app I've created as a part of a technical interview @ some company.

I was given only __2.5 hours__ for writing this project.

You can check out what I ended up with, I haven't touched a line of code since the time ran out, although there are some issues I'd have fixed if I had had a few more minutes.

The initial task was as follows:

- Create "Weather Forecast" mobile app for iOS using Objective-C programming language
- The app should determine current user location
- Ability to select the city for weather forecast (by default use current location) including the following cities: London, Paris, Tokyo, New York.
- All data loads should be asyncronious
- Display the temperature in Celsius for the current moment and the forecast for the whole day (morning, day, evening)
- Any reasonable additions are welcome
- API â€” [http://openweathermap.org/current](http://openweathermap.org/current)
- Deadline in 2.5 hours
